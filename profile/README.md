## LangGenius ðŸš€

**LangGenius** is an LLMOps platform that provides a visual design, context enhancement, observation, and training capabilities for LLMs applications. It allows you to create useful GPT applications quickly and easily, regardless of your programming experience. LangGenius provides a prompt engineering, context enhancement, and fine-tuning to help you create production-grade applications or personal assistants. It supports popular LLM models such as GPT 3 and GPT 3.5 Turbo, and allows you to integrate with Slack, Discord, Telegram, and Feishu. LangGenius is designed to be easy to use and provides a visual prompt editor and debugging interface. You can also analyze and label data sets during application runtime.


## About us
The LangGenius project was created by former Tencent Cloud DevOps team members. We found that developing GPT applications based on OpenAI's API is somewhat cumbersome. Leveraging our years of research and development experience in developer efficiency tools, we hope to enable more people to develop interesting apps using natural language.
