## LangGenius ðŸš€

In the AI singularity of 2023, natural language programming will be accessible to everyone. With LangGenius, an LLMOps platform, building GPT-based applications will take 10 times less effort. Even without programming experience, you can build useful, operable AI applications (not just toys!) in just 6 minutes.
## About us
The LangGenius project was created by former Tencent Cloud DevOps team members. We found that developing GPT applications based on OpenAI's API is somewhat cumbersome. Leveraging our years of research and development experience in developer efficiency tools, we hope to enable more people to develop interesting apps using natural language.
